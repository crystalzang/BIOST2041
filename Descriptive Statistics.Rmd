```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Data Description

```{r}
load("surgery_timing.Rdata")

# summary statistics
summary(stata_data)

# Create vectors of BMI based on gender
female_bmi <- stata_data$bmi[stata_data["gender"] == "F"]
male_bmi <- stata_data$bmi[stata_data["gender"] == "M"]

# Calculate mean BMI
mean(female_bmi, na.rm = T); mean(male_bmi, na.rm = T)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
